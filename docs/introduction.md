# Introduction

These are the core concepts you need to know about `native-modal` and its approach to modals management.

## What is NativeModal ?

NativeModal is a streamlined and efficient library designed to provide 
a simple and direct wrapper around the native HTML [`<dialog>`]() element,
providing an effortless way to implement modals without the need for bulky scripts or complex dependencies.

In summary, `native-modal` is an elegant, performance-oriented solution for implementing modals in web applications.
Its combination of minimal overhead, native browser integration, speed, broad 
compatibility, framework flexibility, and strong typing makes it an excellent 
choice for developers.

## About `<dialog>`

The `<dialog>` HTML element represents a modal or non-modal dialog box or other interactive component, 
such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.

The HTML `<dialog>` element is used to create both modal and non-modal dialog boxes. 
Modal dialog boxes interrupt interaction with the rest of the page 
being inert, while non-modal dialog boxes allow interaction with the rest of the page.

See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) for more details.
